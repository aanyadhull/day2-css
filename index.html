   <h2> 8. What is box-sizing?</h2>
<h3>Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element.
Default value of box-sizing is content-box, in this case the actual width of the box
will be equal to the border and padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width
+ border + padding ).
In case when box-sizing is set to be border-box, then the actual width will be equal
to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of
the box then it will not increase the width of the box.
a) content-box (Default)
b) border-box</h3>

<h2>10. Which property will you use to merge cells vertically in a grid?</h2>
<h3>
grid-column-start and grid-column-end property can be used to merge cells
vertically. It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-column: start/end. If you want to merge
two elements in row then we will have to use grid-row property inside the child
element. Remember these properties are applicable only to child elements not to
parent elements.

<h2>12. What is a Box-model?</h2>
<h3>
The box model in CSS is a set of rules that determine how your web page is
rendered on the internet. In this model, a rectangular box is generated for HTML
elements. This box consists of first content, then padding, then border, and finally
margin
</h3>
<h2>13. What is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h2>
<h3>
display: none;
● The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It
does not take up any space.
● In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements
to fill in.<br>
visibility: hidden;
● The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout
i.e., it takes up the space.
● The element is hidden from view but not the page flow</h3>
